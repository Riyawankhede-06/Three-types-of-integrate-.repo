    <h2>Introduction to External Integrate</h2>

    <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are the backbone of web design, responsible for styling and layout in HTML documents. While CSS can be added directly to 
        HTML using inline styles (via the style attribute) or internal styles , external CSS is the most scalable and maintainable 
        approach for larger project involves storing all your styles in a separate .css file, which is then linked to your HTML document(s).
        This separation of concerns—keeping HTML (structure) and CSS (style) distinct—makes your code easier to update, reuse across multiple pages, and optimize 
        for performance.In this guide, we’ll walk through everything you need to know to create, link, and troubleshoot external CSS stylesheets in HTML,
        even if you’re new to web development.
