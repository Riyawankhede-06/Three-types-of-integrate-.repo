      <p style="color: rgb(41, 147, 151) ;background-color: rgb(186, 176, 172);">Trees are tall, woody plants that play a vital role in life on Earth. They have roots that absorb water and nutrients from the soil, a strong trunk that supports the plant, branches that spread outward, and leaves that produce food through photosynthesis.
         Trees are generally divided into two main types: deciduous trees, such as Oak and Maple, which lose their leaves in autumn, and evergreen trees, such as Pine, which keep their leaves throughout the year. Trees are extremely important because they produce oxygen,
         absorb carbon dioxide, provide food and shelter for animals, prevent soil erosion, and help regulate the climate. Some trees can live for hundreds or even thousands of years, making them some of the longest-living organisms on the planet.</p>
